| **ACID Property**      | **Description**                                                                                                      | **Responsible Component**             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|

| **Consistency**        | Ensures that data remains consistent, and no constraints on related data are violated.                               | Application / Programmer              |
| **Isolation**          | Ensures that one transaction cannot read data from another transaction that has not yet completed.                   | Concurrency Control Manager           |
| **Durability**         | Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, all changes are recorded to a durable medium (such as a hard disk). | Recovery Manager                      |
